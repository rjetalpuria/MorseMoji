## Inspiration
During World War II, governments used the Morse Code to encrypt their messages to communicate with their allies, while keeping it safe from all known and unknown enemies. Today, we are also always on the lookout for better encryption methods, to better protect would data from unethical activities. **Welcome, MorseMoji!**

## What it does
MorseMoji converts the user's message into Morse Code and then converts it to a random assortment of emojis hand-picked by us. Its random nature not only makes the encryption stronger but also, allows for multiple encryptions for the same message, which can only be decoded by MorseMoji.

## How we built it
We build MorseMoji in Android Studio using a combination of Flutter & Dart with Flutter's Morse Code API.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was getting acquainted with Dart and Flutter's environment as this was a first for most of us. Secondly, as this was a remote hackathon, our communication skills were put to test.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to make the app fully working, with a good UI as well as error checking.  We are also proud of MorseMoji as it has a real-world application and has the potential to make an impact in our day-to-day lifestyle.

## What we learned
This was the first hackathon for all of us, and I taught us a lot about collaboration, programming in a time crunch, and different programming standards.

## What's next for MorseMoji
We plan to add more customizability, emoji themes and finally make it publically available on the PlayStore (need a mac to make ios apps; Thanks Apple).
